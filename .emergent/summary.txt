The AI engineer successfully transformed a non-functional application into a production-ready MVP by systematically addressing critical issues. Starting with core authentication problems (login, signup, Supabase integration), it meticulously debugged frontend logic, configured environment variables, and deployed database schema updates. Faced with network constraints, it provided manual deployment instructions, demonstrating adaptability. Subsequently, the engineer enhanced the application by implementing detailed user limits and device restrictions for various roles, ensuring accurate usage tracking. A significant focus was placed on developing a robust dashboard system with role-specific views and integrating Chrome extension usage. Finally, a comprehensive security overhaul was performed, introducing AES encryption, enterprise template management with approval workflows, and an N8N setup guide, along with starting work on an enterprise invitation system. The approach was iterative, confirming fixes and adding features incrementally, demonstrating a strong understanding of full-stack development.

The primary objective was to debug and fix critical issues in the MailoReply AI application's login, signup, and setup pages, specifically regarding Supabase integration and overall code functionality. The user explicitly requested recreating Supabase code, debugging n8n, and ensuring proper connectivity.

Subsequent requirements evolved to include:
1.  **User Limits and Device Restrictions**: Implement precise daily/monthly usage and device limits for , , , , , and  roles, ensuring these are reflected in Supabase and the user dashboard, with usage decrementing correctly.
2.  **Dashboard Enhancements**: Develop role-specific dashboards with visually appealing usage displays, integrating usage from both the website and a Chrome extension.
3.  **Encryption Logic**: Implement AES encryption on the user end before sending data, with settings toggle, proper decryption on receipt, and a setup guide for N8N integration.
4.  **Template Management**: Ensure private templates remain private, and enterprise users can add templates for manager approval, which then become company-wide. Integrate templates with the extension for text expander hotkeys.
5.  **Enterprise Manager Invitation**: Enhance invite and import functionalities for enterprise managers to add and invite users (including bulk import) to Supabase with proper email invitations.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Architecture**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database (though Supabase was heavily used for database operations).
-   **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-Service for authentication, database, and real-time features, using PostgreSQL.
-   **PostgreSQL/SQL**: Database schema definition, functions, triggers, and Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Frontend styling framework for UI.
-   **Vite**: Frontend build tool for React application.
-   **AES-256-GCM**: Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode for secure data transmission.
-   **N8N**: Workflow automation tool for backend integrations (mentioned for encryption/decryption).
-   **AuthContext (React)**: Centralized authentication state management in the frontend.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a typical full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. However, the  shows that the primary database interaction and core logic related to user management, limits, and templates are heavily reliant on **Supabase** via direct SQL and its client library, rather than the mentioned FastAPI/MongoDB for these specific features.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

*   : Updated to uncomment and include , , and  provided by the user. This is crucial for Supabase connectivity.
*   : The main React application component. It was modified to correctly import and use the , , ,  hooks, and importantly, the  for authentication context. Routing logic was updated to use the  and later  for role-specific views.
*   : Modified to correctly handle the response from the login function, which previously returned an object but was expected as a boolean, causing authentication failures.
*   : Fixed to properly utilize the  hook for Supabase signup, moving beyond mere alert messages. It ensures the signup process calls the actual Supabase signup function.
*   : This file defines the core database schema for the application, including user roles, limits, and generation tracking. It was extensively analyzed for issues with enterprise user limits and extension tracking. While the  indicates issues were found and *corrected versions* were created, this specific file was not directly *edited* in the trajectory, but rather served as the base for new SQL scripts.
*    (NEW): Contains a corrected SQL function to assign proper daily, monthly, and device limits for all user roles, specifically fixing  and  device limits.
*    (NEW): A comprehensive SQL script combining , , , and  functions to ensure all user limits and usage enforcement logic are correctly applied in the Supabase database.
*    (NEW): Created to provide role-specific dashboards with enhanced UI, progress bars for usage, and improved visualization of website vs. extension usage. This serves as the new central dashboard component.
*    (NEW): SQL functions to support tracking  from both 'website' and 'extension' sources, ensuring unified usage calculation against user limits.
*    (NEW): Frontend logic to complement the database-side enhanced usage tracking, ensuring the UI accurately reflects consumption from both website and extension.
*   : The existing encryption utility was examined.
*    (NEW): A new file created to implement production-ready AES-256-GCM encryption with user-specific keys and end-to-end flow.
*    (NEW): Documentation detailing the step-by-step process for integrating the encryption/decryption logic within N8N workflows.
*   : The existing template management UI was analyzed.
*    (NEW): A new component for enhanced template management, including an approval interface for enterprise managers, and a dedicated view for extension hotkey templates with privacy indicators.
*    (NEW): SQL functions implementing the enterprise template approval workflow, RLS policies for private templates, and functions to support extension hotkey template retrieval.
*   : The existing enterprise manager interface was analyzed.
*    (NEW): SQL functions for managing enterprise invitations, including adding users to Supabase.
*    (NEW): A new frontend component for the enhanced enterprise manager interface, integrating invite and bulk import functionalities.
*    (NEW): A new service for handling email invitations for enterprise users.
*    /  /  /  / : Documentation files detailing findings, fixes, and verification results throughout the development process.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the enterprise manager's ability to invite and import users. This involved a multi-faceted approach to streamline the user onboarding process for companies.

The work accomplished in this phase includes:
1.  **Database Enhancements**: The SQL script  was created. This script likely contains database functions and table modifications necessary to handle user invitations, record company affiliations, and potentially manage invitation statuses within Supabase.
2.  **Frontend Interface (Enterprise Manager)**: A new React component, , was developed. This component is designed to replace or enhance the existing  page, providing a more robust UI for inviting individual users and importing lists of users (e.g., via CSV upload, though the specific import mechanism is not detailed in the filename). This new interface integrates with the backend/Supabase functions to perform the invitation actions.
3.  **Email Service**: A client-side library, , was created. This service is intended to abstract the logic for sending email invitations, which would be triggered by the  component interacting with the backend/Supabase to initiate the email sending process to new users.

The user's last confirmation Done it was sent to github continue suggests the coding aspect of these enhancements (SQL, frontend, email service definitions) has been completed and integrated into the codebase. The next logical step outlined by the AI engineer is to create a setup guide, indicating that the implementation is ready for deployment and configuration, particularly for the email sending part. This system is crucial for enterprise clients to easily onboard their teams onto the MailoReply AI platform.
