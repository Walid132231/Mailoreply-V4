The previous AI engineer successfully brought the MailoReply AI application from an MVP state to a production-ready system, iteratively addressing authentication, user limits, dashboard features, encryption, and enterprise management. The approach involved deep dives into Supabase SQL, React frontend, and Node.js backend logic, demonstrating strong full-stack capabilities. However, the latter part of the trajectory was plagued by persistent issues with the Emergent platform's preview environment. Despite numerous attempts to configure the application for external accessibility, including modifying server binding, port configurations, build processes, and even deploying minimal test servers, the preview link remained non-functional. The AI engineer consistently confirmed local service status but struggled with the external routing. This culminated in the user's explicit instruction to start from 0 and prioritize fixing the preview, indicating a critical blocker in the deployment pipeline.

<product_requirements>
The core product objective for MailoReply AI is to provide an AI-powered email application. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing fundamental features: debugging login, signup, and setup pages with Supabase integration.

Subsequent feature expansions included:
1.  **User Limits and Device Restrictions**: Implement granular daily/monthly usage and device limits across , , , , , and  roles, synchronized with Supabase and the user dashboard.
2.  **Dashboard Enhancements**: Develop role-specific dashboards with visual usage tracking, integrating data from both the website and a Chrome extension.
3.  **Encryption Logic**: Implement client-side AES encryption with a toggle, ensuring proper decryption on receipt and providing an N8N setup guide.
4.  **Template Management**: Enable private templates, enterprise template approval workflows, and integrate hotkey templates with the Chrome extension.
5.  **Enterprise Manager Invitation**: Enhance the enterprise manager interface for inviting individual users and bulk importing users to Supabase, including email invitations.
6.  **Billing & Subscription**: Add a billing section to settings, connect upgrade buttons to a payment flow (Stripe), automatically update user roles post-payment, verify Superuser dashboard connections, confirm AI generation buttons connect to N8N, and add Google OAuth for sign-in/sign-up.
7.  **Deployment Readiness**: Ensure the application is fully functional and deployable on the Emergent platform, visible in the App Preview tab and accessible via its external URL.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development**: React (frontend), Express (Node.js backend), Supabase (PostgreSQL BaaS for Auth/DB).
-   **Database Management**: PostgreSQL, SQL functions, Row Level Security (RLS).
-   **Authentication**: Supabase Auth, Google OAuth, AuthContext (React).
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
-   **Build Tools**: Vite.
-   **Integrations**: Stripe (payments), N8N (workflow automation), AES-256-GCM (encryption).
-   **Deployment**: Supervisor (process manager), Containerized environment (Kubernetes).

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend (), a Node.js Express backend (), and leverages Supabase for its primary database and authentication. A critical observation from the trajectory is that while a FastAPI backend and MongoDB were initially mentioned, the actual core logic related to users, limits, and templates primarily resides within Supabase SQL functions and is interacted with via the Supabase client. Serverless functions (e.g., for Stripe webhooks) are also present.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

*   : Updated to include Supabase, Stripe, and N8N credentials. Essential for all third-party integrations.
*   : Main React component; updated for routing with AuthProvider, DashboardRouter, and EnhancedDashboard.
*   , : Fixed authentication logic (Supabase  hook) and integrated Google OAuth buttons with  functions.
*   : Extensively refactored to include a password change form, a new Account tab, notification preferences, and a Billing tab. Connects to  for password changes.
*   : Modified to include  function to facilitate Google OAuth.
*   : New component providing role-specific dashboards with usage displays.
*   : Completely rewritten to integrate with real Supabase data (companies, users, invitations) instead of  mocks. Implements enterprise creation with manager invitation, and pending invitations management.
*   : Modified  to update user roles (, ) in Supabase upon successful Stripe subscription events and revert roles on cancellation.
*   : Core schema for user roles, limits, and tracking.
*   : Corrected SQL for all user role limits (daily/monthly/device).
*   : SQL for enterprise template approval workflow and RLS.
*   : SQL for managing enterprise invitations and user onboarding.
*    (NEW): The *final, working* Stripe SQL schema. Resolves conflicts with  and compatibility issues with  by using  blocks.
*   : Created and updated to include all necessary frontend and backend dependencies, along with , , and  scripts.
*   , : Configuration files for Vite, adjusted for local development, production builds, and specific Emergent deployment requirements (e.g., , disabling file watching).
*    (NEW): Centralized supervisor configuration to run the combined frontend/backend as a single  service, listening on  for Emergent preview.
*    (NEW): A shell script to build and start both frontend and backend for the single  supervisor service.
*    (NEW): A very minimal Node.js Express server, created in the final attempts to debug the Emergent preview, serving a simple HTML page on .

<pending_tasks>
-   The email sending integration for the enterprise invitation system needs to be fully implemented and tested (only the client-side library  was created, and backend functions in SQL, but actual email dispatch via a service like SendGrid or N8N needs full setup).
-   The Danger Zone account deletion in Settings is a placeholder.
-   The core application is currently in a state where its external accessibility in the Emergent preview environment is the primary blocker.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a critical task: debugging and fixing the application's inability to load in the Emergent App Preview tab and its corresponding external URL. This issue persisted despite multiple attempts to configure port binding, build processes, and service management.

The engineer's latest approach, driven by user frustration and explicit instruction to start from 0, was to:
1.  **Clear the environment**: Stopped all existing supervisor services ([2025-08-07T00:08:18.734Z] info  code-server 4.102.1 47e9d43922b5764e3ead3bbf31d9ad23676604d6
[2025-08-07T00:08:18.735Z] info  Using user-data-dir /root/.local/share/code-server, , ).
2.  **Attempt file cleanup**: Tried to remove existing files (though some commands failed).
3.  **Create a new minimal server**: A new file, , was created. This is a very basic Express.js server designed to serve a simple Hello World or test HTML page on port 8080 and bind to , with the explicit goal of verifying *any* output on the Emergent preview.
4.  **Update Supervisor configuration**: The supervisor configuration for the  service was updated to specifically run this new .

The current state is that the engineer has just updated the supervisor configuration and is poised to restart services to run this absolute minimal server. The primary goal is to establish basic connectivity and visibility in the Emergent preview, as all complex features (password change, billing, Google OAuth, enterprise invites) remain inaccessible due to this foundational deployment issue.

Restart services and verify if the minimal  server is accessible via the Emergent preview URL.
